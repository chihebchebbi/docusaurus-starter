# 10 Open-Source Tools for Threat Informed defense and MITRE ATT&CK

The MITRE ATT&CK framework has revolutionized how we approach threat-informed defense, enabling defenders to align their detection, response, and adversary emulation strategies with real-world tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

Over the past months, Iâ€™ve been actively developing 10 open-source tools designed to help security teams operationalize ATT&CK, improve detection engineering, and enhance adversary emulation. These tools are:


1. **PDF2ATTACK**: Extracts TTPs from PDF reports and generates a MITRE ATT&CK navigation layer.

2. **Automated Threat-Informed Defense Assessment Tool**: Enables efficient assessment of detection and hunting coverage against specific threat actors or profiles.

3. **Sentinel 2 D3FEND**: Retrieves Microsoft Sentinel rules mapped to MITRE ATT&CK and generates corresponding MITRE D3FEND defenses.
